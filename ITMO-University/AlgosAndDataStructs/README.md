# Lab 2:									  
 
 Task: Use Dijkstra postfix algorithm (shunting yard algorithm) to	  
 write a program that calculates the value of an algebraic expression	  
 in a form of string, where parentheses can be used to specify priority.
 Supported operators are: "+", "-", "*", "/", "^", "~" (unary minus).	  
 >For example, Input:  (-5+7)/32+0.15*(9^3-184)

> Output: 81.8125
